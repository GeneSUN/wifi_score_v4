### 1. Situation & Background

In recent years, Verizon launched a new product—5G Home WiFi—as a fixed wireless access (FWA) solution.
However, the early customer experience revealed a consistent issue: network performance was unstable, with intermittent drops in speed, reliability, and overall quality.

To address this, the company initiated a project to continuously monitor network performance and proactively identify customers experiencing degraded service.

The same scoring mechanism is also used for traditional wired WiFi products, making the system broadly applicable across access technologies.

### 2. Impact

In essence, this project functions as a **telecom-specific feature store**, and **rule-based anomaly detection system** built on top.

The WiFi Score allows Company to:

1. Detect customers whose network performance is declining.
2. Provide targeted fixes, support, or upgraded service packages.
3. Understand performance issues at scale across millions of devices.

This makes the score a foundation for both customer experience improvement and network operations insights.

### 3. Task Breakdown

The WiFi Score framework involves three major dimensions:

1. Multi-Aspect Evaluation (KPI Level)

The score evaluates several performance dimensions—such as speed, reliability, and coverage.
Each dimension is tracked through a specific set of KPIs or features.

2. Multi-Device Aggregation (Customer Level)
A customer’s overall score aggregates signals from multiple devices in the home environment.
Each device contributes its own set of metrics, which are then combined into a customer-level performance assessment.

3. Daily Monitoring (Time Level)

**Illustration: A Medical Analogy**

You can think of WiFi Score like evaluating a patient’s health:
- A patient (customer) has multiple systems: nervous, circulatory, respiratory.
- Each system contains multiple organs, each with its own critical indicators:
  - Heart → heartbeat
  - Cardiovascular system → blood pressure
  - Respiratory system → oxygen level

These indicators combine to form a summary health score.

## 4. Actions Taken

Carefully selected critical KPIs based on empirical telecom knowledge and network behavior.

Transformed raw telecom signals into interpretable features (e.g., combining multiple raw fields into meaningful metrics—similar to BMI combining height and weight).

Defined thresholds and rules to categorize performance as Good, Fair, or Poor.

## 5. Results

The outcome is a rule-based monitoring system that:
- Flags anomaly conditions in customer WiFi performance
- Generates interpretable scores for both engineering and customer-support teams
- Doubles as a feature store for downstream analytics and machine learning

## 6. Key Challenges

### 🏢 6.1 Cross-Department Alignment & Communication

This project involved multiple departments (Network Engineering, Customer Support, Data Science, and Product), and even people from different corporate entities.  
This brought both collaboration and competition, creating challenges:

| Challenge | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Partial information sharing | Teams collaborated, but carefully controlled how much detail or credit to share. |
| PM group was demanding but delayed | PM frequently delayed documentation and clarification, but still imposed tight deadlines. |
| Ownership and visibility concerns | Our team originally proposed the idea, but another group later redefined the scoring logic and gained visibility. |

**Learning:** Success wasn't just about technology — it required communication, expectation management, and visibility handling across teams.

### 📈 6.2 Project Scope Expanded Rapidly

The Wi-Fi Score initiative started from a simple idea and gradually grew as more use cases and requirements were added:
- https://github.com/GeneSUN/wifi_score_v4/blob/main/granularization-corner%20case/The%20Power%20of%20One%20Granularity.md

| Expansion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Product Scope | Started with Wi-Fi only → then extended to both Wi-Fi **and** 5G Home (FWA). |
| Granularity | Began with **daily** customer-level scoring → later refined to **hourly** and **device-level** monitoring. |
| Technical Depth | Started with simple rule-based scoring → then added richer feature engineering → built a feature store → finally integrated ML-based scoring and anomaly detection. |

- [https://github.com/GeneSUN/wifi_score_v4/tree/main/Hourly_Score](https://github.com/GeneSUN/wifi_score_v4/blob/main/Hourly_Score/Real-Time%20Wi-Fi%20Score%20Challenge.md)

**Learning:** The challenge wasn’t a one-time build, but continuously growing the system while keeping it maintainable and scalable.



---

### 🧠 6.3 Domain + Machine Learning Integration

Developing the score required blending domain expertise with data science:

- Telecom knowledge (RSRP, CQI, CPE connectivity, Wi-Fi stability, packet loss)
- Feature engineering across **network**, **device**, and **customer** levels
- Transition from thresholds → probabilistic detection → ML anomaly detection and churn models
- Designing a score that both engineers and customer-support teams could interpret

**Learning:** ML is powerful, but without domain context and interpretability, it has limited business value.

### ⚙️ SON / Per Client Steering

**Definition:**  
SON (*Self-Optimizing Network*) automatically manages Wi-Fi performance by dynamically steering clients between bands or access points.

- **Band Steering:** Move STA from 2.4 GHz → 5 GHz to balance range and speed.
- **AP Steering:** Move STA between router ↔ extender for optimal coverage.

**Raw Data:**  
- `Diag_Result_band_steer`  
- `Diag_Result_ap_steer`

**Methodology:**
1. Count steering records (`Diag_Result_band_steer.intend`).
2. Time window: **1 day**.
3. Filter by:
   - `STA_type == "2"`
   - Action categories and counts:

| Action | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 15,041,539 | Failed |
| 1 | 40,875,296 | Succeed |
| 2 | 156,165,390 | Start |
| 3 | 47,574,699 | Timeout |
| 4 | 52,615,049 | Cancel |

## 🚀 Speed

### 📶 RSSI (Signal Strength)

**Data Structure:**  
Each station has multiple records for 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz connections.

**RSSI Thresholds:**

| Band | Poor | Fair | Good | Excellent |
|------|------|------|------|------------|
| 2.4 GHz | < −78 | −71 to −77 | −56 to −70 | < −55 |
| 5 GHz | < −75 | −71 to −75 | −56 to −70 | < −55 |
| 6 GHz | < −70 | −65 to −70 | −56 to −65 | < −55 |

**Categorization Levels:**
1. **STA Record Level:** Evaluate per record.
2. **STA Connect Type Level:**  
   If >12 records below threshold in a band → STA classified under that category.
3. **STA Level:**  
   Aggregation of all connect types for final classification.
4. **Serial Number Level:**  
   Combine results per device.
